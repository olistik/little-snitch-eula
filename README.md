# Little Snitch's EULA change proposal

A proposal to make Little Snitch's EULA more respectful to the users' freedom.

[Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html) is a really cool product and even though its source code is not available it's a pity that the EULA expressly prohibits reverse engineering.

This clause represents a restriction to the users' freedom of knowing what the **purchased** software is doing, which is ironically the purpose of Little Snitch itself :-)

If you are Little Snitch user and this proposal resonates to you, you can tell them via their Twitter account [@littlesnitch](https://twitter.com/littlesnitch).
